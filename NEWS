+ In command-line/batch mode, the GCDkit should run also operation systems other than Windows, 
  notably Linux or Mac OSX. 

+ New Windows GUI installer based on Tcl/Tk (including also Windows 10, and people without 
  administrative rights ;-)) 

+ User-defined templates for stand-alone Figaro plots or their plates. They can be uploaded into the
  directory Diagrams/User and then employed for standard plotting (i.e. not classification)
  purposes. This mechanism allows easy and fully automatic expansion of the plotting capabilities
  of the GCDkit system. For further info, see the file @README.txt in the directory in question.

+ Functions allowing overplotting new datapoints onto standard single binary, ternary,
  spiderplots or multiple plots, including the diagram templates (figOverplot, 
  figOverplotDiagram, overplotDataset, underplotDataset). For plotting serves 
  a reference dataset, either real-world data (say compiled from literature) or a numeric 
  matrix spanning, for instance, from petrogenetic modelling.

+ New possibility of obtaining dataset by online search of the EarthChem.org database 

+ New plugin 'disclosure' for log-transformation of compositional data.

+ New geotectonic/general purpose diagrams:
  - La/Yb vs. Nb/La and La/Yb vs. Th/Nb of Hollocher et al. (2012)
  - La/10-Y/15-Nb/8 of Cabanis and Lecolle (1989)
  - Zr/Y-Th/Yb of Ross and Bedard (2009)
  - YbN vs. LaN/YbN of Martin (1986) to distinguish adakites and TTGs
  - F-M-W diagram (Ohta and Arai 2007) for chemical weathering of igneous rocks
  -  three binary plots for discrimination of lavas from destructive plate 
     boundaries (Pearce 1982) 
  - ternary plot for classification of A-type granites (Grebennikov 2014)
  - binary plot of Paulick et al. (2006) to poretray the mantle peditotite fertility
