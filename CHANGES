Version 5.0, 28 March 2018 (El Chupacabra) 
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

New features:
-------------
+ In command-line/batch mode, the GCDkit should run also operation systems other than Windows, 
  notably Linux or Mac OSX.   

+ New Windows GUI installer based on Tcl/Tk (including also Windows 10, and people without 
  administrative rights ;-)).

+ User-defined templates for stand-alone Figaro plots or their plates. They can be uploaded into the
  directory Diagrams/User and then employed for standard plotting (i.e. not classification)
  purposes. This mechanism allows easy and fully automatic expansion of the plotting capabilities
  of the GCDkit system. For further info, see the file @README.txt in the directory in question.

+ Five examples of user-defined geotectonic plots - three binary plots for discrimination
  of lavas from destructive plate boundaries (Pearce 1982), Al2O3/SiO2 vs MgO/SiO2 binary plot 
  for mantle peridotites of Paulick et al. (2006) and one ternary for classification
  of A-type granites (Grebennikov 2014).

+ New possibility of obtaining dataset by online search of the EarthChem.org database 
  (GUI by O. Laurent, ETH Zurich). 

+ New plugin 'disclosure' for log-transformation of compositional data.

+ New zircon saturation model of Boehnke et al. (2013).

+ figOverplot - allows overplotting new datapoints onto standard single binary, ternary,
  spiderplots or multiple plots. For plotting serves a reference dataset, either
  real-world data or a numeric matrix spanning, for instance, from petrogenetic modelling.

+ figOverplotDiagram - a function that serves for overplotting new data points onto
  Figaro-compatible templates defined for classification or geotectonic plots
  (binary or ternary, stand alone or extracted from plates).

+ overplotDataset, underplotDataset - front-end functions to the previous two. They add
  new data points from a reference dataset stored (by function pokeDataset) in the memory
  onto any type of standalone Figaro-compatible plots (or their plates). This can be done
  either into foreground, or (with some limitations) into background.

+ plateAddReservoirs - a function that enables adding compositions of selected geochemical
  reservoirs or ideal minerals to a plate of Figaro-compatible plots (binary, ternary or spider).

+ calcAnomaly, a function for calculating a magnitude of any anomaly on spiderplot,
  based on concentrations of selected neighboring (not necessarily adjacent) elements.

+ new geotectonic/general purpose diagrams:
  - La/Yb vs. Nb/La and La/Yb vs. Th/Nb of Hollocher et al. (2012)
  - La/10-Y/15-Nb/8 of Cabanis and Lecolle (1989)
  - Zr/Y-Th/Yb of Ross and Bedard (2009)
  - YbN vs. LaN/YbN of Martin (1986) to distinguish adakites and TTGs
  - F-M-W diagram (Ohta and Arai 2007) for chemical weathering of igneous rocks

+ new training dataset atacazo.data giving the whole-rock major- and trace-element contents, 
  together with Sr and Nd isotopic compositions of lavas from two volcanic complexes in Ecuador: 
  the Atacazo and the Ninahuilca (Hidalgo, 2006; Hidalgo et al., 2008). 
  This dataset, kindly provided by Silvana Hidalgo, shidalgo@igepn.edu.ec, is used in a worked 
  example (chapter 25) of Janousek et al.’s book (2016).

+ new training dataset blatna.data from the Central Bohemian Plutonic Complex, Czech Republic
  (Janousek et al. 2000, 2010). It could be, together with sazava.data already present, used to test 
  dataset switching etc.

+ New function figFixLim() extends the scales of both axes of a binary plot automatically 
  if necessary to accommodate all the data points.

+ Spanish translation of the classification plots (courtesy of Tomas Grijalva,
  Geology Department of UNAM, Mexico).

+ new normalization scheme of Anders and Grevesse (1989) for chondrite-normalized REE spiderplots.

+ setTransparency can also return now the hexadecimal code(s) of specified colour(s) with the
  desired degree of transparency (if setting the parameter save=FALSE).

+ better behaviour of many functions in batch mode (in RTerm, Jupyter, on Linux/Mac etc.)......

+ stripBoxplot was extensively tested and modified, it allows to specify pch, col, cex, and also 
  addition to a preexisting plot.

Bug fixes, performance improvements:
------------------------------------

+ CIPW norm was incorrectly calculated for silica-poor nephelinites and melilitites 
  kp, ol, lc and di were all affected (rules 29-30 of Hutchison 1974) 
  - bug was tracked down by Heinz-Günter Stosch.

+ functions assignSymbLab and assignColLab can assign plotting symbols or colours not only
  according to the levels of the chosen label, but also sample names. They can be newly
  invoked in batch mode as well.

+ assignSymbLett works in batch mode now.

+ groupsByDiagram accepts a new parameter fun, which is a name of plotting/classification 
  function to be used (in batch mode)

+ legends are correctly displayed now, even if plotting colours are assigned by
  numeric variable (such as SiO2).

+ figUser was not working with parameters xlim, ylim. Newly it can be called with a parameter redraw=FALSE.

+ Slope and intercept of the regression line, returned by function figAddFit(), were swapped in the 
  previous versions.

+ selectNorm allows now selecting a sample, or a search pattern for average of several samples,
  also directly, i.e. in the batch mode.

+ selectPalette and assignColVar accept now also names of user-defined palette functions.

+ stripBoxplot allows to specify the relative scaling of the circles plotted, and/or
  the data for the underlying boxplots (for comparison).

+ fixed ASI index in Frost() that was not sufficiently corrected for Ca in apatite (thanks to Benjamin Jost, UK).

+ fixed were some problems of figBW and plateBW - now they set also background fields into gray colour
  (e.g., on spider plots, PearceNbThYb, PearceNbTiYb).

+ addContours can be called in direct mode, with some graphical parameters. It will work on both a
  standalone Figaro-compatible plot or a plate thereof.

+ peekDataset accepts also sequence number of the dataset now.

+ (hopefully) fixed long-standing problems with setting the data directory.

+ GCDkit should start correctly in Windows RStudio.

+ WRanh was not calculated properly in mixed datafiles, where occur samples with both FeO and Fe2O3 
  determined, as well as only those with FeOt

+ in figMulti legend is drawn last, over any grid lines etc.

+ Labels for isotopic plots involving initial epsilon values now better fit the plotting area
 
+ If all radiogenic isotope analyses are recalculated to the same age, this age is correctly shown 
  now instead of the general "i" subscript

+ OConnorPlut can accept specification of variables with modal or normative compositions upon 
  call (i.e. in batch mode) 

+ assignColVar may newly ignore the outliers (values outside the given quantiles). 

+ profiler has been opening an unecessary empty plotting window


Version 4.1, 10 February 2016 (Chlopskie jadlo)
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

New features:
-------------
+ Switching between datasets (datasets can be stored using the function pokeDataset
  for later use, when they can be restored by peekDataset or selectDataset).

+ The datasets stored by the function pokeDataset, as well as those freshly loaded into
  the system using the functions loadData and accessVar, become components of a list WRCube.

+ WRCube can be cleared using the function purgeDatasets;
  only the most recent copy of the current dataset survives this operation.

+ figCex, plateCex accept now the value NA (no quotes) that means no plotting
  of symbols (most useful on spiderplots if only lines are desired).

+ figAddReservoirs checked and reprogrammed; it newly does work for ternary plots,
  and is Figaro-compatible for binaries, ternaries and spiders. It also includes a
  lot of new arguments, mainly plotting parameters.

+ new function figOverplot allows overplotting a reference dataset onto
  Figaro-compatible binary plots, ternary plots, or spiderplots.
  The reference dataset, stored in an arbitrary global variable, can contain either
  real-world data or a numeric matrix  spanning from petrogenetic modelling.

+ new functions oxide2ppm and ppm2oxide to recast wt.% of the given oxide to ppm of cation
  (and back)

+ triplot accepts a new parameter cex; triplotadd in addition parameters labs and types.

+ platform-independent functions tk_winDialog and tk_winDialogString written in Tcl/Tk.


Bug fixes, performance improvements:
------------------------------------
+ selectAll was not correctly restoring labels; as a consequence any consequent
  plots failed.

+ selectAll completely rewritten using the dataset switching, i.e. backup copy of data
  stored in the WRCube.

+ Variables WR.bak, WRanh.bak, milli.bak and labels.bak are not needed anymore.

+ spider.contour was sometimes opening an extra empty plotting window.

+ spiders plotted after any plate rendered the Plot editing menu inactive.

+ All HTML output is now generated in the data directory (data.dir), where
  all the users should have the writing permission.

+ saveData was failing if there were some completely empty columns present in the dataset.

+ to reservoirs.data were added near complete crustal compositions of Taylor & McLennan (1995).

+ Wedge did not ask for x axis in GUI.

+ OConnorPlut boundaries fixed (made the same as for volcanic rocks) if normative (and not modal)
  compositions are being used.

+ If adding results with variable names to the dataset, any trailing spaces in the beginning are dropped.

+ Abbreviation of pyrite (Pr) in the Catanorm was changed to Py in order not to be confused with Praseodymium.

+ calcCore does not require global variables anymore, but can use also those from the parental environment.

+ accessVar does not utilize Windows clipboard to transfer data into variables WR and labels anymore.

+ prComp returns results into a namesake variable.

+ New function plateLabelSlots to annotate individual slots by letters, numbers or Roman
  numerals

+ Rutile saturation algorithms of Ryerson & Watson (1987) and Hayden & Watson (2007)

+ Possibility to assign colours according to values of a variable (assignColVar)


Bug fixes, performance improvements:
------------------------------------

+ this is the version accompanying the book:

Depreciated:
------------
+ dropped was the function 'Add a new plot to a script' (customPlot),
  which is not needed anymore as most of the functions can be called from the command prompt now.


Version 3 beta, 2 February 2013 (Curry Chicken)
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Bug fixes, performance improvements:
------------------------------------
+ GCDkit starts R in SDI mode, regardless that which was been installed

+ New form of spiders, colour-coded according to the independent variable, such as silica contents
   (spider.contour).

+ Anomaly plot was not assigning the plotting symbols correctly

+ Debon and Le Fort values were wrongly calculated if only total Fe (FeOt) was available

+ Numerous small amendments to the code


Version 3 beta, 18 March 2012 (Drunken Springbok)
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Bug fixes, performance improvements:
------------------------------------

+ Single tectonic diagrams are now fully Figaro-compatible, multiple ones use the plates concept

+ Fixed Sr growth diagram which also became fully Figaro-compatible.

+ Fixed problems with figMulti()
  - it was producing the first plot of different geometry
  - gives a message when the number of slots (nrows x ncols) is less than the number of groups
    defined/diagrams to be produced
  - uses plate concept

+ Plates exported to PS were truncated

+ plotWithLimits was autosetting incorrectly the maximum of the yaxis

+ 87Sr/86Sr ratio of the (CH)UR was not correctly age-corrected on the 87Sr/86Sri - EpsNdi plot.

+ Versioning by codenames


Version 3.0 beta, 21 September 2011 (On ski slopes of Moninec)
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

New features:
-------------
+ Plates concept – multiple plots, such as Harker plots or individual graphs produced by Multiple
  plots by groups (figMulti) can be edited similarly to the stand alone, Figaro-
  compatible diagrams (through the menu Plot editing). Moreover, the properties of the whole plate
  or all its diagrams can be changed simultaneously. Such plates can be user-defined and
  contain any mixture of Figaro-compatible plots, e.g., binary, ternary, classification plots,
  spiderplots...

  WARNING! For correct function, R needs to be installed in multiple windows (SDI interface,
  which is a default).

+ Persistent Options, that can be modified in a GUI and then saved to a configuration file.

+ French and Czech translations (locales) for classification plots.
  Other languages can be added easily.

+ Many plotting functions redesigned so that they can be run solely from the command line, without
  any GUI dialogues. This enables their use in a batch mode (by an external macro, Sweave etc.)

+ Help pages contain more examples that can run directly.

+ Naming the plotting windows for better orientation (if R is installed as SDI interface, i.e. each
  plotting window is separate).

+ New classification diagrams:
  - Ternary plot of Na2O-Al2O3-K2O (mol. %) for judging the balance of alumina and the two
    alkali oxides.

+ New geotectonic diagrams:
  - Diagram of Sylvester (1989) to distinguish collision-related alkaline granites from
    calc-alkaline and peraluminous suites.

  - Ternary plot Hf - Rb/30 - Ta*3, proposed by Harris et al. (1986) for classification of
    collisional granites.

  - Geotectonic diagrams for (ultra-) basic rocks of Verma (2006) based on natural log-
    transformed ratios of major and minor elements.

  - Geotectonic diagrams for (ultra-) basic rocks of Agrawal (2008) based on natural log-
    transformed ratios of trace elements.

+ Function spider2norm for production of double normalized spider plots (see the help
  page for advantages of this approach; this double normalization is also newly implemented
  in spiderboxplots.


+ Plot editing - functions to outline groups on binary and ternary plots using contours
  and convex hulls (contourGroups and chulGroups).

+ Statistics:
  - Function summaryRangesbyGroup for printing ranges of selected geochemical parameters
    in individual groups of analyses.

  - New function to plot so-called stripBoxplots - i.e. stripplots of selected parameter in
    individual groups, each underlain by a boxplot. Optionally also a second variable can
    be portrayed by various size of plotted circles.

  - New parameters to summaryAll, summaryByGroup, aimed at batch mode use.

+ Choice of several styles of labeling x axis in spiderplot (e.g., rotated and/or
  offset labels).

+ Display variable (connected to the function printSamples) can handle formulae now.

+ New parameter to mergeDataCols(all.rows) that preserves all samples present in at least
  one of the files.

+ New in plugins:
  - Wedge diagrams and concentration ratio plots (Ague 1994) became an part of the isocon.r
    plugin to expand the range of tools available for addressing mass balance during
    open-system processes such as metasomatism, partial melting, migmatitization or
    metamorphism.

  - JungAlTitemp.r: New plugin implements thermometer of Jung and Pfänder (2007) based on
    experimentally determined Al2O3/TiO2 ratios in granitic magmas.

+ Help: links to original papers through the DOI system. Much more examples added.


Bug fixes, performance improvements:
------------------------------------

+ Eliminated (hopefully) mysterious crashes upon repeated data loads.

+ The size of plotting characters is specified now directly in the data frame "labels",
  (column name "Size") removing many problems with functions previously not
  respecting the cex parameter.

+ Improved plotting of spiderplots, if the plotting symbols were specified for each sample
  individually (adding legend etc...).

+ Fixed bug in interpretation of negative values in loadData, when the minus sign was
  preceded by trailing spaces (thanks to J-F Moyen).

+ selectSubset and selectSamples can handle mg#, Mg# and extra spaces; they can be called
  from the command line now.

+ Multiple plots by groups (figMulti) - spider did not assign correctly the plotting
  symbols. For spiderplots, plotting symbols can be omitted altogether.
  for less cluttered diagrams. The function does plot legends if defined in the
  original template.

+ Appending several datasets by rows failed to merge the character expansion attribute (cex).

+ plotWithLimits and numerous other functions, calling it for plotting, did not assign
  cex parameter correctly.

+ Transparent background to classification, geotectonic, binary and ternary plots as well
  as spiderplots (for better export via the PostScript function).

+ Fixed problems with setting boundaries in classification diagrams to black.

+ Returned are correct initial isotopic ratios/epsilon Nd values even for age = 0
  (present-day values).

+ figAddReservoirs can handle now any ratios, including isotopic data (such as 87Sr/86Sr)

+ LaRocheCalc did return 0 and not NA if no major-element data were available.

+ Merging a dataset did not work, when the previous data set was read from Clipboard

+ printSamples can handle formulae now.

+ printSamples did not format correctly the names for ratios (replaced slash by a dot)

+ Eu/Eu* and other variables containing asterisk were not accessible by some functions

+ Fixed was the function Frost which did not work at all if only FeOt was available
  (thanks to Jitendra Kumar for pointing out the problem).

+ Fixed and thoroughly checked the function mergeDataCols.

+ Spiderboxplot (including the box and percentile plots) can be called with several new
  parameters, such as range of y axis and fill colour. It can also produce double
  normalized plots.

+ summaryByGroup and its derivatives summaryByGroupMjr and summaryByGroupTrc can handle formulae now.

+ summaryAll and its derivatives summaryMajor and summaryTrace can handle formulae now.

+ figSelect did not respect the cex parameter, the correct number
  of selected samples is reported (originally it was from the dataset
  and from the number of samples actually plotted). For the spiderplots,
  the legend is redrawn so that it shows only the samples currently plotted.

    reservoirs (from the file 'reservoirs.data') or selected rock-forming minerals (from the file
    'idealmins.data')

+ Added agpaitic index (Norms|Miscellany)

+ New plugin:
  - isocon.r - isocon plotting after Grant (1986)

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++

New features:
-------------
+ If the data file contains negative values or values preceded by lesser-than sign ('<'), the user can
  replace them by half of the detection limit specified. Otherwise, these values are treated as if
  they have not been determined at all.

+ (technical) Changed names many of the functions (all of those which contained dot) to make the
  package compliant with the S3 methods.

Bug fixes, performance improvements:
------------------------------------
+ If not specified in the data file, the 87Rb/87Sr and 147Sm/144Nd are calculated
  from elemental concentrations of Rb and Sr or Sm and Nd, respectively.

+ Mode - printed correctly the results but failed to return them for instance for
  subsequent Copying to clipboard.

+ Loading  *.peg files used by PetroGraph (Petrelli et al. 2005) (library RODBC
  required).

+ QAPF plot (Streckeisen 1973) and O'Connor's (1965) Ab-An-Or diagram

+ For Figaro compatible plots, it is now possible to display only
  part of the data set using the function Plot editing|Select samples.

+ Plot editing contains a new function 'Text annotations off' for
  switching off textual labels on the current plot

+ Adding custom tick marks and/or grid lines (menu Plot editing)

Bug fixes, performance improvements:
------------------------------------
+ Completely changed installation programme (using freeware Inno
  Setup)

+ Brand new help system driven by CSS

+ Fundamentally revised, less cluttered menu structure

+ Advanced plotting, HTML.tables and odbc.export ceased to exist as
  plugins and became an integral part of the system

+ Remaining plugins (saturation, SrNd,  tetrad...) move to a
  separate menu.

+ Much improved output to HTML

+ Binary plots do not ask for scales of x and y axes - these can be set subsequently
  from the menu Plot editing

+ Fixed a bug in boxplots for a single variable (including the isotopic data):
  the axis scale was too narrow, and thus the whiskers did not show correctly

+ Major performance improvements in calculation and graphical scripts, better
  selection of variables, ternary plots generated by scripts have ticks by default

+ Fixed reading from Access files with multiple tables

+ Spider plots by group - patterns were not working

+ Pearce et al. (1984)- boundaries slightly shifted in some diagrams (in
  particular Nb-Y)

+ Groups by outline and Groups by diagram fixed (were not working properly)

+ Selecting samples for 3D plots was not functioning

+ In specification of filename for saving (data, results, scripts....), omitting
  the suffix caused crashes.

+ Default data directory became also the default directory for saved diagrams etc.
  Autoload of GCDkit is better implemented, starting of virgin R without it
  embedded became possible

+ Found a remedy for the long standing problem with filled contours
  in logarithmic axes

+ Repaired highlight.selection().

+ Extensive testing and debugging of numerous small problems

+ Unzooming - it used to fail to restore the original diagram correctly

+ Fixed corrupted sample file with chemical compositions of various igneous rocks

+ Problems with correct labeling axes/apices corresponding to
  formulae in binary,ternary plots, multiple plots, coplots, plots with circles,
  3D plots, various statistics....

+ Plotting symbols and colours were not allocated right for subsets
  plotted on binary boxplots

+ Identification of samples on Anomaly plots, plotting colours on
  the said diagram if subset was selected

+ Scaling x axis for multiple plots (such as Harkers) reflects
  extremes of the selected subset rather than the whole data file

+ Small adjustments to the spiderplots

+ (Nearly) bulletproof wrapper for norms, geotectonic and classification plots

+ For larger datasets (>200 samples), dialogue box + beep after a normative
  calculation has been finished

Version 2.0, 1 May 2005
++++++++++++++++++++++++
New features:
-------------
+ New way of distribution - GCDkit became a full-blown R package that can be
  loaded by the "library" command. This means that the system does not reside
  in a memory image (.Rdata) file any more, which is now free to use.

+ Data directory can be specified now

FILE INPUT/OUTPUT + Loading Excel, Access and DBF files (library RODBC required)

+ Importing data from popular geochemical packages NewPet, IgPet and MinPet
  (library RODBC required)

+ While loading, the values #WHATEVER! (Excel error messages) and "< x"
  (used by some authors to indicate values below detection limit) are
  automatically replaced by NA

+ Moreover, all the character values in columns recognized as numeric (according
  to internal dictionary) are assumed to be typos and are replaced by NA.

+ Plugin "odbc_export.r" for saving data and results in XLS format, as well as
  results into Access (library RODBC required)

PLOTTING SYMBOLS AND COLOURS + Symbolic names of colours (657 in total) can be now used for plotting symbols.
  Type colours() to get their list or use the menu option "Show available colours"
  to see them.

+ Possibility to specify scaling of the plotting symbols for each sample
  individually (via the parameter 'cex')

+ Possibility to autoassign plotting symbols/colours by selected label (if not
  specified in the data file) upon loading

DATA HANDLING + Molecular weights of oxides are now calculated using function molecular.weight
  and external database stored in a file "MW.data"

+ Improvements to selections of multiple variables (select.columns.labels). If
  the response is empty, the user can pick the required variables by CTRL+left
  mouse button.

+ New option to select samples falling into specified fields of a classification
  diagram interactively (select.by.diagram)


SPIDERPLOTS + Spiders (for selected samples) are now Figaro compatible. This means that the
  plots can be annotated, colours,scaling and other parameters changed and
  individual samples/patterns identified

+ New normalization values for spiderplots (e.g. REE after Nakamura 1974)

+ Intelligent scaling of both variants of spider diagrams by groups.

OTHER PLOTS + Improved ternary plotting, option of plotting ticks in custom ternary plots.
  Better implementation of Figaro/Plot editing (e.g., it is possible to modify
  the labels for apices). While zooming, plot window boundaries are shown.

+ Added new classification plots of Middlemost (1994)

+ Brand new are anomaly plots (peterplots), binary boxplots and stripplots by
  groups (the latter resides in menu Statistics)

+ Shervais plot made Figaro compatible

+ In Plot editing, if prompted for a colour name, pressing ENTER invokes a list
  of all available colours.

+ Sr and Nd isotopic development diagrams are now Figaro compatible

MISC + Added new test data files demonstrating import from Excel (XLS), NewPet (ROC),
  MinPet (DBF) and Access (MDB).


Bug fixes, performance changes:
-------------------------------
+ Fixed several problems related to the changes brought about by the version 2.1
  of R

+ Corrected routines for merging two data sets

+ Plugin saturation.r: fixed a critical error in calculating of apatite saturation
  temperatures for peraluminous rocks (after Bea et al. 1992)

+ A problem with recalculation on anhydrous basis (FeOt was not taken into
  account if only total iron was determined). This caused normally slight shifts
  in the TAS diagram down and left.

+ Spider plots do not close all the graphic windows any more, fixed problems if
  plotting a single sample

+ Plotting variables with names including "/ * " - binary and ternary plots

+ Bug in selecting a single variable (if more partial matches were found)

+ Fixed problems with redrawing ternary plots (the scaling was slightly different)

+ Troubles while unzooming a zoomed diagram

+ Bug in printing information about the samples identified on a custom binary plot

+ Custom scripts - were not appending a variable properly

+ More robust error handling, especially in Plot editing

+ Help thoroughly checked and updated

+ The loading routine completely rewritten and checked

+ An error in formula does not cause the calculation routine to stop with a
  warning. Instead, the calculation routine is called recursively. The same holds
  for selecting multiple variables.

+ Plot summary by element and group rewritten completely

+ Editing numeric data (edit.data(WR)) did not recalculate WRanh and milli as
  required

Version 1.2, May 2004
++++++++++++++++++++++++
New features:
-------------
+ Harker plots enable to specify the x axis range

+ Copying results to clipboard

+ New functions assign.symb.lab, assign.col.lab, assign.symb.group, edit.lab.factor,
  join.groups replace the corresponding files + are more efficiently implemented

+ Function fig.add.curve (Menu Plot editing|Add curve) plots a curve expressed
  as a function of x

+ Spiderplots make possible normalization by a selected sample or average values
  for a specified subset(i.e. changes in the function select.norm)

+ y axis of spiderplots better scaled, taking into account the real extremes
  (spiders for selected samples)

+ functions fig.load, fig.save enable saving and restoring Figaro-compatible
  plots (including both the template and underlying data)

+ function fig.gbo to set groups on the basis of polygonal areas on a
  Figaro-compatible plot

+ Plugin advanced graphics (contour plots on the basis of the Figaro templates)

+ Searching/subsetting - list of samples (separated by commas) can be typed in
  directly

+ Subset by range - empty response invokes a list of samples to pick from

+ Regular expressions can be used within the Boolean conditions

+ Further improvements to error handling

+ Enhanced function Mode, returns more information and has more user friendly
  interface

+ Plugin SrNd: Sr growth curves added

Bug fixes:
----------
+ Streckeisen plot Q'-ANOR that did not function at all

+ Apatite saturation temperatures (module saturation.r) - calculation after
  Pichavant et al. rewritten. The iteration routine for this model was giving
  bad temperatures for only slightly peraluminous samples (A/CNK < 1.05). The
  iterations are much quicker now.

+ Loading and pasting files using comma for decimal point is now possible

+ Function save.results saves also lists and tables as tab-delimited files

+ Eliminated crashes when empty specification of a variable(s) was entered (in
  many functions)

+ Adding menus upon loading a second or subsequent files (new problem to R 1.81)

+ Long persisting problems with scaling text size of labels on spiderplots fixed

+ Crashes while copying results to clipboard, if they were a list one item of
  which corresponded to a vector


Version 1.1, 30 Nov 2003
++++++++++++++++++++++++
New features:
-------------
+ Improved error handling

+ Plugin html tables (requires a package R2HTM to be installed)

+ More colour schemes for xyz plot

+ Improvements to the searching routines

Bug fixes:
----------
+ Menu item Select by range (misplaced bracket)

+ Quartiles in statistical summary

+ Definition of the list REE

+ Fixed select.norm that did not work in rw1080

+ Colour matching of the PS output for xyz plot
