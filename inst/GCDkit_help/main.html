<p align="justify">
    The <font color="#800000"><b> Geochemical Data Toolkit (GCDkit)</font></b> is a program for handling and
    recalculation of geochemical data from igneous and metamorphic rocks. It is built using the freeware R language, version for Windows, which in itself
    provides a flexible and comprehensive environment for data analysis, graphics and software development. The GCDkit was designed to eliminate routine
    and tedious operations involving large collections of whole-rock data and, at the same time, provide access to the wealth of statistical functions
    built into R. <br>
    Data management tools include loading and saving data files in a number of formats, data editing, searching, grouping and
    generation of subsets. Implemented are a variety of calculation and normative schemes, for instance CIPW and Mesonorm, as are the common geochemical
    graphs (e.g. binary and ternary graphs, Harker plots, spider plots, and several dozens of classification and geotectonic discrimination diagrams).
    The graphical output is publication ready but can be further retouched by built-in commands.

  <p align="justify"><font color="#800000"><b>Getting started</font></b>

<br> The easiest way of importing data into <i>GCDkit</i> is from plain text data files, delimited by tabs, commas or semicolons (the delimiter
  is recognized automatically, as is a decimal point/comma). See sample data file <i>sazava.data</i> provided.</p> <p align="justify">As a (less
  forgiving) alternative, the data can be pasted, via clipboard, from any Windows-based software, including MS Excel. If reading Excel or DBF
  files directly (given the  <i>RODBC</i> support is available), please stick to the same simple structure required by the text files. See manual
  entry for <a href="../html/loadData.html"> loadData</a> or the PDF file <a href="../doc/getting_started.pdf" target="_blank"> Getting
  started</a> if more information on data files is needed.</span></p>

  <p align="justify">Before proceeding, it is strongly recommended to browse
  through these help pages (or the <a href="../doc/GCDkit_manual.pdf"  target="_blank">manual</a>)
  or at least the <font color="#800000"><a href="../doc/cheat_sheet.pdf"  target="_blank">cheat
  sheet</a></font>. If pressed by time, read at least the <font color="#800000">
  <a href="technical.html">Technical notes.</a></font></p>
