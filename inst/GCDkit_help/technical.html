                    After double clicking the icon <i>GCDkit </i> opens
                    <i> “RConsole”</i>, a text window serving for entry of commands as well as
                    display of textual output.
                      In addition, during the session are typically opened one or more graphical windows.

                  <li> <p align="justify" style="margin-top: 6"> Please note that the <i>GCDkit</i> menu appears right of the menus of the R
                      system itself.

                        be stopped from menu that appears after pressing the right mouse button. If experiencing problems, the
                        computation/plotting can be interrupted anytime by hitting <i>Esc</i> or from the menu (<i>Misc|Stop current
                       computation</i>).

                          More immediate response is obtained when print buffering

                            The errors encountered while running the <i>GCDkit</i> system and displayed in the
                            Console are (mostly) not fatal. In majority of the cases it means that the
                            command can be re-run (one can simply press the up/down arrows in the Console to scroll
                            through the commands history), entering/modifying the parameters that
                            caused the crash. If the problem persists, record the details and send the data file to us, so we can fix the bug.                      </li>
                      <li> <p align="justify" style="margin-top: 6"> This <i>GCDkit</i> was build&nbsp;in <b>R version 3.4.3</b>.&nbsp; Due to
                          the quick developments in the R project, it is blocked in the previous versions, and the correct function in any future
                          version of R cannot be guaranteed!

                            <p align="justify" style="margin-top: 6"> <i>GCDkit</i> requires the R packages <i>base, stats, methods, utils,
                              graphics, MASS, foreign, grid, tcltk </i> and <i>lattice </i> to be installed (which is normally the case).

                          <li> <p align="justify" style="margin-top: 6"> Strongly recommended are also packages <i>RODBC </i> enabling import and
                              export into the MS Excel, Access and dBase formats, <i>R2HTML</i> serving for output into HTML format, <i>sp</i>
                              for spatial analysis of the data and <i>XML</i> for reading/writing XML-formatted files. They are part of our Windows 
                              distribution of <i>GCDkit</i> (i.e., that with the Windows installer) but if need be, they can be uploaded via the menu 
                              <i>Packages|Install package(s) from <a href="http://www.r-project.org">CRAN</a> </i>(online Internet connection required). 
                              Offline installation is also possible: zip file downloaded from the CRAN site can be installed latter via menu 
                              <i> Packages|Install package(s) from local zipfiles.</i>

                                <p align="justify" style="margin-top: 6"> <b>Note that recommended systems</b> to run <i>GCDkit</i> are Windows
                                  XP/Vista/7/8/10, even though the latter three are to be preferred. Try to keep the number of opened graphical
                                  windows to a necessary minimum, as the R may become instable, failing to redraw graphical windows if too many
                                  of them are being open. It is always a good idea to close the unnecessary ones, for instance using the function
                                  <i>graphicsOff()</i> or the corresponding item from the menu <i>GCDkit</i>.
                              </li>
                              <li> <p align="justify" style="margin-top: 6"> <i>PDF</i> output should be given preference, as it is the most accurate 
                                  and it also supports semitransparency used in many diagrams. 
                                  A viable alternative is <i>PostScript</i>. Using <i>WMF</i> (Windows metafiles) or copying via clipboard are to be 
                                  discouraged, as the latter two methods lead&nbsp;sometimes to distortions of the graphs. For saving simply right-click 
                                  the graphical window and select the desired format.</li>

                                      The use of special symbols or accented characters (such as in some East
                                      European languages) is mostly okay but it may also sometimes cause unexpected
                                      problems. So please be sensible, especially in the variable names.
